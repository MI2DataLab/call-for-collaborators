# Summer is Coming

MI2 Data Lab is looking for students for summer internships.
The internship takes 2 months. It can be either June-July or July-August or August-September 2019.
Projects for internships are related with [eXplainable Artificial Intelligence or AutoML/AutoEDA tools developed in the MI2DataLab](https://github.com/ModelOriented/DrWhy/blob/master/README.md).

For the two-months internship, you can expect 5000 net / 5500 gross paid as a contract to perform a specified task.

Developed packages and libraries will be released as open-source packages under GPL license. Best projects can be turned to research articles.

XAI and AutoML are the hottest trends in AI/ML. Join our team to work on them.
